<b> Intro </b>
<li> We "glue" together similar data from the folders of the file we've downloaded and repacked into our working directory </li>
<li> We search through the giant list of variables for only ones that indicate mean and standard deviation. 
Once searched, they've chosen and named properly in accordance with features.txt file</li>
<li> We switch the names of activities to the ones we get from activity_labels.txt file </li>
<li> After we've made a proper naming to columns, we create a new table,
containing average measures for each subject for each type of activity </li>
